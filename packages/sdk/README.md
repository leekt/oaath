OAAth browser client and Kernel/ZeroDev runtime. See the
[repository README](https://github.com/leekt/oaath#readme).

The headless Grant provider returns `4200` for `wallet_showCallsStatus` unless
the adopter supplies a wallet-owned status presenter. Executable
`wallet_sendCalls` entries without `to` are valid contract-creation requests,
but OAAth does not own a creation policy and refuses them with its fixed
provider execution error (`-32000`).

The Draft ERC-7836 prepared-call profile accepts only the approved operator's
external signature. `secp256k1` supports `frontend` or `application_backend`
custody; `webauthn-p256` supports `frontend` custody only. `oaath_hosted` is
rejected before preparation.

Its opaque five-minute context is current-version-only, durable, and consumed
once. A recreated IndexedDB realm resumes the retained prepared operation and
any ambiguous send without preparing, signing, or submitting another operation;
older, unreadable, stale, and already-consumed contexts do not authorize a new
operation.
